# TD-Game-Project
This is a game made using GDScript in a Godot engine. mainly a school project but also a learning experience, using game engines

some of the art is designed by us however some of it was taken off of websites such as https://opengameart.org

The plan with this project is to finish it after the school project has been submitted and have documentation as well as a finished game available to play
Any one is welcome to try it for free take and mess with the code as they wish by downloading the repository

More to be added later on throughout the project

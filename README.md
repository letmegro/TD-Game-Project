# TD-Game-Project
This is a game made using GDScript in a Godot engine. mainly a school project but also a learning experience, using game engines

some of the art is designed by us however some of it was taken off of websites such as https://opengameart.org

The plan with this project is to finish it after the school project has been submitted and have documentation as well as a finished game available to play
Any one is welcome to try it for free take and mess with the code as they wish by downloading the repository

Note *this project was added into its own repository a bit late in the term so there is a bit of history in terms of contribution missing
      however what was done by which programmer is written in the head of each script*

More to be added later on throughout the project
